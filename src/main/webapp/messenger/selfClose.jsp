  selfClose.jsp - Utility page for closing popup windows
  
  This simple JSP page automatically closes the current browser window or tab
  when loaded. It's typically used after completing an action in a popup window
  to return control to the parent window.
  
  Usage scenarios:
  - After completing message composition in a popup
  - Following successful attachment upload
  - After delegate selection or cancellation
  
  Technical note:
  - Uses top.window.close() to ensure the topmost window is closed
  - Works in popup windows opened via JavaScript
  - May be blocked by browser security in regular tabs
  
  @since 2003
