  selfCloseAndRefreshOpener.jsp - Closes popup and refreshes parent window
  
  This utility JSP page performs two actions when loaded:
  1. Refreshes the parent window that opened this popup
  2. Closes the current popup window
  
  This is commonly used after operations that modify data displayed in the
  parent window, ensuring the parent shows updated information after the
  popup completes its task.
  
  Usage scenarios:
  - After sending a message (refreshes message list)
  - After modifying message groups (updates group display)
  - Following delegate selection (updates delegate info)
  
  Technical notes:
  - top.opener refers to the window that opened this popup
  - Refresh happens before close to ensure it executes
  - Requires popup to be opened via window.open()
