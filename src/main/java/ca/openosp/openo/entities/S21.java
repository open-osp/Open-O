/**
 * Entity representing S21 payment reconciliation records from BC MSP (Medical Services Plan) billing system.
 *
 * <p>The S21 record format is part of British Columbia's Teleplan billing system and contains detailed
 * payment information for healthcare provider billing transactions. Each S21 record represents a single
 * payment line item showing amounts billed, amounts paid, balances, and cheque information.</p>
 *
 * <p>This entity is typically used for:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Processing payment remittance advice from BC MSP</li>
 *   <li>Reconciling billed amounts with actual payments received</li>
 *   <li>Tracking payment history and outstanding balances</li>
 *   <li>Generating financial reports for healthcare providers</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Key fields include payee identification (payeeNo, payeeName), financial data (amtBilled, amtPaid,
 * balanceFwd, newBalance, cheque), and administrative metadata (dataCentre, dataSeq, mspCTLno).</p>
