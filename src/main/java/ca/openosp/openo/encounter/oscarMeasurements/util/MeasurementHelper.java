/**
 * Utility class providing helper methods for measurement flowsheet operations and clinical decision support.
 * This class contains static utility methods that support measurement-related workflows,
 * particularly for flowsheet evaluation and clinical alert generation.
 * 
 * <p>The helper focuses on analyzing measurement data to determine if clinical action is required,
 * such as identifying missing measurements, out-of-range values, or overdue assessments based
 * on configured flowsheet rules and clinical guidelines.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Key functionality:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Flowsheet evaluation and warning detection</li>
 *   <li>Clinical decision support through measurement analysis</li>
 *   <li>Integration with {@link MeasurementFlowSheet} for rule-based assessments</li>
 * </ul>

 * @since 2006
 * @see MeasurementFlowSheet
