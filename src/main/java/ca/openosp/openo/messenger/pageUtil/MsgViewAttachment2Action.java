/**
 * Struts2 action for viewing file attachments associated with messages.
 * 
 * <p>This action retrieves and displays file attachments that have been included
 * with messages in the messaging system. It handles the retrieval of attachment
 * data from the database and prepares it for display in the user interface.
 * Unlike PDF attachments which are stored separately, these are typically
 * Base64-encoded file attachments stored directly in the message table.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Key functionality:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Validates read permissions for messaging operations</li>
 *   <li>Retrieves attachment data from the message table</li>
 *   <li>Prepares attachment for display or download</li>
 *   <li>Maintains attachment ID for reference</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Security considerations:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Requires read permission on messages to view attachments</li>
 *   <li>No additional validation that user has access to specific message</li>
 *   <li>Attachment content is not sanitized before display</li>
 * </ul>

 * @version 2.0
