/**
 * Struts2 action for importing patient demographics from remote facilities.
 * 
 * <p>This action handles the cross-facility patient demographic import process when messages
 * are received from remote facilities through the Integrator. It provides a two-phase import
 * workflow:</p>
 * 
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Phase 1: Automatic import or user selection - When a message references a patient from
 *       a remote facility, the system attempts to match them with a local patient. If no exact
 *       match is found, potential matches are presented to the user for selection.</li>
 *   <li>Phase 2: Manual linking - If the user selects a local patient from the potential matches,
 *       the remote demographic is linked to the selected local patient record.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>The import process ensures that patient records are properly synchronized across facilities
 * while maintaining data integrity and avoiding duplicate records. This is critical for inter-facility
 * messaging where patients may be treated at multiple locations within a healthcare network.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Security considerations:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Requires Integrator to be enabled for the facility</li>
 *   <li>Uses logged-in user's permissions for demographic access</li>
 *   <li>Validates facility IDs and demographic numbers</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Request parameters:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>remoteFacilityId - The ID of the remote facility</li>
 *   <li>remoteDemographicNo - The patient ID in the remote facility</li>
 *   <li>messageID - The associated message ID</li>
 *   <li>selectedDemographicNo - (Optional) User's selection from potential matches</li>
 * </ul>

 * @version 2.0
