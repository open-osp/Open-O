/**
 * Struts2 action for clearing message attachments from the session.
 * 
 * <p>This action provides a simple mechanism to clear all attachments that have been
 * accumulated in the message session bean during message composition. It is typically
 * invoked when a user wants to remove all attachments from a draft message or reset
 * the attachment state before composing a new message.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The action operates by retrieving the MsgSessionBean from the HTTP session and
 * calling its nullAttachment() method, which removes all stored attachment data
 * including Base64-encoded PDF documents and file attachments.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Usage scenarios:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>User clicks "Clear Attachments" button in message composition</li>
 *   <li>Automatic cleanup when starting a new message</li>
 *   <li>Error recovery when attachment processing fails</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>This class is marked as final to prevent inheritance, ensuring the simple
 * attachment clearing behavior cannot be modified through subclassing.</p>
 * 
 * @version 2.0
 * @since 2003
 * @see MsgSessionBean
