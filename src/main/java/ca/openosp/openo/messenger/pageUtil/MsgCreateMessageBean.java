/**
 * Legacy JavaBean for message creation functionality.

 * <p>This class appears to be a template or example JavaBean that was created
 * during early development but is no longer actively used in the messaging system.
 * It contains only a single "sample" property with basic getter/setter methods.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The bean follows the JavaBean specification with a no-argument constructor
 * (implicit) and property access methods. However, its current implementation
 * suggests it may have been intended as a placeholder or example that was never
 * fully developed.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Historical context: This bean was likely created when the messaging system
 * was first being developed using Struts 1.x ActionForms, but has been superseded
 * by more comprehensive session beans like MsgSessionBean.</p>
 * 
 * @deprecated This class appears to be unused and should be considered for removal
 * @version 1.0
 * @since 2003
 * @see MsgSessionBean
