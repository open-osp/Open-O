/**
 * Legacy data class for managing reply message recipients across local and remote healthcare facilities.
 * 
 * <p>This class was originally designed to organize message recipients into local and remote
 * provider lists, allowing the messaging system to differentiate between providers within
 * the same facility and those at connected remote facilities.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The class maintains two separate lists:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>localList: Providers within the current facility/location</li>
 *   <li>remoList: Providers at remote connected facilities</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * @deprecated This class is no longer needed in the current messaging implementation.
 *             The functionality has been replaced by improved recipient management
 *             in the MessengerManager and related classes.
 * @version 1.0
 * @since 2002
