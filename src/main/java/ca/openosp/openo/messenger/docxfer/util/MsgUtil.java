 * 
 * <p>The class is designed to work with XML document transfers where special
 * characters need to be properly escaped to prevent parsing errors and
 * potential security issues.</p>

     * Escapes single quotes and backslashes in a string for safe SQL usage.
     * 
     * <p>This method processes a string to escape special characters that could
     * cause issues in SQL queries or string literals. It prefixes single quotes (')
     * and backslashes (\) with a backslash to neutralize their special meaning.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Example transformations:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>"O'Brien" becomes "O\'Brien"</li>
     *   <li>"C:\temp" becomes "C:\\temp"</li>
     *   <li>"It's a test\path" becomes "It\'s a test\\path"</li>
     * </ul>
     * </p>
     * 
     * <p>Note: This method provides similar functionality to MsgStringQuote.q() but
     * is specifically used in the document transfer context. Modern applications
     * should use parameterized queries instead of string escaping for better security.</p>
     * 
     * @param Expression The input string to escape
     * @return The escaped string with quotes and backslashes properly escaped
     * @deprecated Use parameterized queries or PreparedStatements for better SQL injection prevention
