# Magenta Health Copyright Header

This header should be added to files only when explicitly requested. Do not automatically add it to files, but also do not remove it if it already exists in a file.

**Important**: Always check the current year using `date +%Y` and use that year in the copyright notice (or later if the current year is more recent than 2025).

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Only add when explicitly requested** - Do not proactively add this header to files
2. **Preserve existing headers** - If a file already has this header, do not remove or modify it
3. **Placement** - Should be placed at the very top of Java source files, before package declaration
4. **Year** - Always check current year with `date +%Y` and use that year (minimum 2025)
   - Run `date +%Y` to get current year
   - Use the current year if it's 2025 or later
   - Never use a year earlier than 2025
